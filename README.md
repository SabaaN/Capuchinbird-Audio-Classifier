# Capuchin Bird Audio Classifier

This project is a small audio classifier designed to detect and classify audio signals of the Capuchin bird. The purpose of this project is to gain experience in working with audio data and building machine learning models for audio classification tasks. It involves preprocessing audio data, extracting features, training a TensorFlow model, and evaluating its performance.




### To run this project, you'll need 

Python 3.8+

TensorFlow

TensorFlow I/O

Matplotlib



The project dataset should contain audio recordings of Capuchin bird calls, ideally in .wav format. Ensure the dataset is organized into separate folders for each class (e.g., capuchin and background_noise).
